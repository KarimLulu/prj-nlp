1. Perform initial data collection for your project.
I think wikipedia is enough to check how this project works in general. More data will only make the process slow.
Also correlation between WordNet trees and NNSE word distance can be measured to see if NNSE represent such relations as synonyms,hyperonyms etc..

2. Devise and describe a way to collect data for your course project using crowdsourcing or from the users. Implement a proof-of-concept.
There is no need to data from crowdsorcing on initital stage, there is a lot of texts in wikipedia and interent. The problem is 
calculations.
