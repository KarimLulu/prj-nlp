# Email analyzer
Main idea - create a tool for obtaining information about meeting or event from email letter.
I think it would be a very useful application or extension, that reduce the time for creating events in the calendar.

Information to extract:
* time
* main topic or reason
* attendees
* place or address

## Dataset
I found [Enron email dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset) - 500,000+ emails from 150 employees of the Enron Corporation.
Also I wanna find or generate and include emails from different companies about interviews, meetups, courses.
