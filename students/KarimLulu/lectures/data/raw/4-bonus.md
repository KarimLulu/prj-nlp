## Shmification

Shm-reduplication is used to indicate irony, sarcasm, skepticism, or disinterest about the discussed object. It is typically formed by the following rules:
- a consonant cluster at sentence start is replaced with shm- ("table-shmable", "breakfast-shmeakfast")
- a vowel cluster at sentence start doesn't change ("apple-shmapple")
- when speaking two words, usually only the second word is shm-reduplicated ("Jimmy Hendriks-Jimmy Shmendriks", "data science-data shmience")
- no change is needed if a word already begins with shm- ("shmaltz-shmaltz", "schmuck-schmuck")
- use sm- instead of shm- with words that contain a sh ("Ashmont-Smashmont", not "Shmashmont").

Your task is to write a script that can shmificate any word properly. You can write the program for any natural language (English, Ukrainian, German, etc.).
