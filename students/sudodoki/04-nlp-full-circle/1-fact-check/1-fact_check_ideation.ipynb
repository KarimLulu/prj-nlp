    "У межах цієї задачі ви побудуєте систему видобування фактів на правилах, а також інструменти для оцінювання цієї системи та фактів, які вона добуватиме.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Домен\n",
    "\n",
    "Виберіть домен, для якого можна побудувати невелику базу даних на основі Wikipedia, DBPedia, IMDB тощо. Проаналізуйте домен і напишіть програму для побудови бази даних. Приклади доменів:\n",
    "- актор і фільми, в яких він знімався\n",
    "- письменник і книжки, які він написав\n",
    "- музичний гурт і його учасники/концерти/альбоми з роками діяльності/випуску\n",
    "- компанія і всі її CEO/CTO з роками діяльності\n",

    "- винахідник та його винаходи\n",

    "2.2. Напишіть програму, яка опрацьовує текст статті (саме текст, а не таблички, якщо такі є) та витягає з нього інформацію про ваш домен. Цю інформацію ви будете порівнювати зі сформованою базою даних.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Оцінювання результатів\n",
    "\n",
    "Розробіть метрику, яка покаже, наскільки інформація, яку ви дістали зі статті, збігається з інформацією в вашій базі даних. Скільки пропущеної інформації з кожного боку? Чи є часткові збіги? (Наприклад, ім'я СЕО збігається лише частково або ім'я СЕО збігається, а роки діяльності різні.)\n",
